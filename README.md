# Java Minesweeper Game

A classic implementation of the Minesweeper game built in Java with a custom linked grid data structure.

## Features

- Classic Minesweeper gameplay
- Custom linked list grid implementation
- Recursive clearing of empty cells
- GUI interface with color indicators

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java AWT for GUI components

## Implementation Details

This project showcases:
- Object-oriented design principles
- Custom data structures (LinkedGrid)
- Recursive algorithms for game logic
- Event-driven programming

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Compile the Java files
3. Run the Main class

```
javac *.java
java Main
```


## Project Structure

- `Game.java`: Contains game logic and board management
- `LinkedGrid.java`: Custom grid implementation using linked nodes
- `LinearNode.java`: Node class for the linked data structure
- `GUICell.java`: Represents a single cell in the UI
- `GUI.java`: Handles the graphical user interface
- `BombRandomizer.java`: Places bombs randomly on the board

## Learning Outcomes

Building this project helped strengthen my understanding of:
- Linked data structures
- Recursive algorithms
- Java GUI development
- Object-oriented design
